By continuing on this site you agree to indemnify me from any damages arising due to your use of this program, except where such agreement is disallowed by law. You have been made aware, that HTML is not supposed to be used as a Programming Interface (although it can, see above); use or follow on your own risk. I cannot be held liable if you are fired from your job for suggesting to develop the next product in HTML-as-a-Programming-Interface. The devil is (and has always been) in the details. Do not parse my HTML with regular expressions. Please note that I cannot be held responsible if you accidentally summon demons, aliens or the end of the world by using any of my software. By continuing to use this site you agree to only sue me after making me the legal owner of your soul. No warranty is included. This contract may be void under your, my and likely most other jurisdictions. These terms of use are governed by German law, except when agreed otherwise or in cases, where such an agreement cannot be made. In the unlikely event, that any clause of these Terms of Use are illegal, inapplicable or impossible to execute, all other clauses shall remain in force.</p>
